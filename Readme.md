## Description

Containers are the #1 most wanted and #2 most loved software developer tools, and helps millions of researchers and IT professionals build, share and run any app, anywhere - locally, in the institutionâ€™s infrastructure or in the cloud. It is a pivotal tool for Reproducible Research that allows anyone with a container to run any analysis the ways it was designed, including all the dependencies and necessary software. Research Computing and Data is offering this hands-on workshop as an introduction to containerization. In this introduction, you'll learn the fundamentals of containerization and how to build/use container images.
